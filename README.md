In this notebook, we will use Isolation Forest method to do anomaly detection.

First, the dataset will be explored using holoviews and bokeh visualisation library. This library is useful as it offers interactive graphs.

Next, we'll use Isolation Forest modelling to detect outliers. We will use different threshold values to see how detected outliers change.

As a result, the algorithm detects several anomalies successfully.
